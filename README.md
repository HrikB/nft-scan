# NFT Scanner

## Motivation
The motivation for this project was very simple. I am wildly passionate about the NFT space and was interested in playing around with OpenSea API. So I scratched that itch by creating this little NFT scanner where you input your Ethereum Wallet address and it returns all the NFTs you own in an appealing way. This was also a way for me polish my React development skills.
